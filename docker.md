# Running Charm with Docker

The official Charm images are available at [charmcli/charm](https://hub.docker.com/r/charmcli/charm).

```sh
docker pull charmcli/charm:latest
```

Here’s how you might run `charm` as a container. Keep in mind that
the database is stored in the `/data` directory, so you’ll likely want
to mount that directory as a volume in order keep your your data backed up.

```sh
docker run \
  --name=charm \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -p 35353:35353 \
  -p 35354:35354 \
  -p 35355:35355 \
  -p 35356:35356 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  charmcli/charm:latest
```

or by using `docker-compose`:

```yaml
---
version: "3.1"
services:
  soft-serve:
    image: charmcli/charm:latest
    container_name: charm
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data:/data
    ports:
      - 35353:35353
      - 35354:35354
      - 35355:35355
      - 35356:35356
    restart: unless-stopped
```

To set up TLS under Docker, consider using a reverse proxy such as
[traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/overview/) or a web server with
automatic HTTPS like [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https).
