# Sunsetting Charm Cloud

To continue innovating in this space and supporting our larger projects, we need to keep our small team focused on the most impactful work. On **29 November 2024**, we will be sunsetting Charm Cloud. At that time we will be removing the servers from production and archiving the project on GitHub. Charm Cloud is self-hostable, so you can back up your data before that time and continue using this project on your own server.

The code will continue to be open source and publicly available. If you love this project and would like to maintain a fork, please do.

[Learn more](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docs/self-hosting.md) about self-hosting Charm Cloud.

## Impacted tools

To configure both [Skate](https://github.com/charmbracelet/skate) and [Glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) to work with your own server, you'll need to update the Charm Cloud client environment variables. Glow historically integrated into the Charm Cloud via a stashing feature, but as of [Skate v1.0.0][skatev1] and [Glow v2.0.0][glowv2] the Charm Cloud integration in both applications has been removed (Skate now operates on a local database: to migrate your data see the [Skate v1.0.0 Release Notes][skatev1]). For those using older versions, you can continue to use Charm Cloud features with your own server. Here are the relevant environment variables:

```go
// Config contains the Charm client configuration.
type Config struct {
  Host        string `env:"CHARM_HOST" envDefault:"cloud.charm.sh"`
  SSHPort     int    `env:"CHARM_SSH_PORT" envDefault:"35353"`
  HTTPPort    int    `env:"CHARM_HTTP_PORT" envDefault:"35354"`
  Debug       bool   `env:"CHARM_DEBUG" envDefault:"false"`
  Logfile     string `env:"CHARM_LOGFILE" envDefault:""`
  KeyType     string `env:"CHARM_KEY_TYPE" envDefault:"ed25519"`
  DataDir     string `env:"CHARM_DATA_DIR" envDefault:""`
  IdentityKey string `env:"CHARM_IDENTITY_KEY" envDefault:""`
}
```

Charm is a set of tools that makes adding a backend to your terminal-based
applications fun and easy. Quickly build modern CLI applications without
worrying about user accounts, data storage and encryption.

## Features

* [**Charm KV:**](#charm-kv) an embeddable, encrypted, cloud-synced key-value store built on [BadgerDB][badger]
* [**Charm FS:**](#charm-fs) a Go `fs.FS` compatible cloud-based user filesystem
* [**Charm Crypt:**](#charm-crypt) end-to-end encryption for stored data and on-demand encryption for arbitrary data
* [**Charm Accounts:**](#charm-accounts) invisible user account creation and authentication

There’s also the powerful [Charm Client](#charm-client) for directly accessing
Charm services. [Self-hosting](#self-hosting) a Charm Cloud is as simple as
running `charm serve`.

## Installation

Use a package manager:

```bash
# macOS or Linux
brew install charmbracelet/tap/charm

# Arch Linux (btw)
pacman -S charm

# Nix
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.charm

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install charm

# Fedora/RHEL
echo '[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install charm
```

Or download a package or binary from the [releases][releases] page. All
major platforms and architectures are supported, including FreeBSD and ARM.

You can also just build and install it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm.git
cd charm
go install
```

## Charm KV

A powerful, embeddable key-value store built on [BadgerDB][badger]. Store user
data, configuration, create a cache or even store large files as values.

When you use Charm KV your users automatically get cloud backup, multi-machine
syncing, end-to-end encryption, and the option to self-host.

```go
import "github.com/charmbracelet/charm/kv"

// Open a database (or create one if it doesn’t exist)
db, err := kv.OpenWithDefaults("my-cute-db")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer db.Close()

// Fetch updates and easily define your own syncing strategy
if err := db.Sync(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Save some data
if err := db.Set([]byte("fave-food"), []byte("gherkin")); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// All data is binary
if err := db.Set([]byte("profile-pic"), someJPEG); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

Charm KV can also enhance existing [BadgerDB][badger] implementations. It works
with standard Badger transactions and provides top level functions that mirror
those in Badger.

For details on Charm KV, see [the Charm KV docs][kv].

## Charm FS

Each Charm user has a virtual personal filesystem on the Charm server. Charm
FS provides a Go [fs.FS](https://golang.org/pkg/io/fs/) implementation for the
user along with additional write and delete methods. If you're building
a tool that requires file storage, Charm FS will provide it on
a networked-basis without friction-filled authentication flows.

```go
import charmfs "github.com/charmbracelet/charm/fs"

// Open the user’s filesystem
cfs, err := charmfs.NewFS()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Save a file
data := bytes.NewBuffer([]byte("some data"))
if err := cfs.WriteFile("./path/to/file", data, fs.FileMode(0644), int64(data.Len())); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Get a file
f, err := cfs.Open("./path/to/file")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer f.Close()

// Just read whole file in one shot
data, err := cfs.ReadFile("./path/to/file")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### FAQ

<details>
	<summary>Are there any file size limits?</summary>
	<p>There are no limitations in file size per se, although there's a 1 GB cap on storage for the free Charm accounts, but you can get unlimited if you self-host the Charm Cloud.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Is it possible to not have a local copy of the database?</summary>
	<p>No. Skate uses BadgerDB and keeps a local copy of the key-value store. The local databases are synced through the Charm Cloud.</p>
</details>

For more on Charm FS see [the Charm FS docs][fs].

## Charm Crypt

All data sent to a Charm server is fully encrypted on the client. Charm Crypt
provides methods for easily encrypting and decrypting data for a Charm user.
All key management and account linking is handled seamlessly by Charm.

For more on Charm Crypt see [the Charm Crypt docs][crypt].

## Charm Accounts

The best part of Charm accounts is that both you and your users don’t need to
think about them. Charm authentication is based on SSH keys, so account
creation and authentication is built into all Charm tools and is invisible and
frictionless.

If a user already has Charm keys, we authenticate with them. If not, we create
new ones. Users can also easily link multiple machines to their account, and
linked machines will seamlessly gain access to their owners Charm data. Of
course, users can revoke machines’ access too.

### Backups

You can use `charm backup-keys` to backup your account keys. Your account can
be recovered using `charm import-keys charm-keys-backup.tar`

## Charm Client

The [`charm`][releases] binary also includes easy access to a lot of the functionality
available in the libraries. This could be useful in scripts, as a standalone
utility or when testing functionality.

```bash
# Link a machine to your Charm account
charm link

# Set a value
charm kv set weather humid

# Print out a tree of your files
charm fs tree /

# Encrypt something
charm crypt encrypt < secretphoto.jpg > encrypted.jpg.json

# For more info
charm help
```

### Client Settings

The Charm client can be configured using environment variables. These are the
defaults: 

* `CHARM_HOST`: Server public URL (_default cloud.charm.sh_)
* `CHARM_SSH_PORT`: SSH port to connect to (_default 35353_)
* `CHARM_HTTP_PORT`: HTTP port to connect to (_default 35354_)
* `CHARM_DEBUG`: Whether debugging logs are enabled (_default false_)
* `CHARM_LOGFILE`: The file path to output debug logs
* `CHARM_KEY_TYPE`: The type of key to create for new users (_default ed25519_)
* `CHARM_DATA_DIR`: The path to where the user data is stored
* `CHARM_IDENTITY_KEY`: The path to the identity key used for auth

## Self-Hosting

Charm libraries point at our Charmbracelet, Inc. servers by default (that’s
cloud.charm.sh), however it's very easy for users to host their own Charm
instances. The `charm` binary is a single, statically-linked executable capable
of serving an entire Charm instance:

```bash
charm serve
```

### Server settings

The Charm server can be configured using environment variables. These are the defaults:

* `CHARM_SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS`: Network interface to listen to (_default 0.0.0.0_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_HOST`: Hostname to advertise (_default localhost_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_SSH_PORT`: SSH server port to listen to (_default 35353_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_HTTP_PORT`: HTTP server port to listen to (_default 35354_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_STATS_PORT`: Stats server port to listen to (_default 35355_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_HEALTH_PORT`: Health server port to listen to (_default 35356_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_DATA_DIR`: Server data directory (_default ./data_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_USE_TLS`: Whether to use TLS (_default false_)
* `CHARM_SERVER_TLS_KEY_FILE`: The TLS key file path to use
* `CHARM_SERVER_TLS_CERT_FILE`: The TLS cert file path to use
* `CHARM_SERVER_PUBLIC_URL`: Server public URL, useful when hosting the Charm server behind a TLS enabled reverse proxy
* `CHARM_SERVER_ENABLE_METRICS`: Whether to enable collecting Prometheus metrics (_default false_) Metrics can be accessed from `http://<CHARM_SERVER_HOST>:<CHARM_SERVER_STATS_PORT>/metrics`
* `CHARM_SERVER_USER_MAX_STORAGE`: Maximum FS storage for a user (_default 0_) Zero means no limit

To change hosts, users can set `CHARM_HOST` to the domain or IP of their
choosing:

```bash
export CHARM_HOST=burrito.example.com
```

See instructions for
[Systemd](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/systemd.md) and
[Docker](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md).

#### Storage Considerations

The max data you can store on our Charm Cloud servers is 1GB per account.
By default, self-hosted servers don't have a data storage limit. Should you
want to set a max storage limit on your server, you can do so using
`CHARM_SERVER_USER_MAX_STORAGE`

### TLS

To set up TLS, you should set `CHARM_SERVER_USE_TLS` to `true`, and specify
`CHARM_SERVER_HOST`, `CHARM_SERVER_TLS_KEY_FILE`, and
`CHARM_SERVER_TLS_CERT_FILE` file paths.
