# Charm Crypt

We take privacy seriously. All data stored in the Charm Cloud is encrypted,
decryptable only with your Charm account. That means even we don't have the
ability to decrypt or view your data.

## Usage

```bash
# encrypt secrets
charm crypt encrypt < secrets.md > encryptedsecrets.md

# decrypt secrets
charm crypt decrypt < encryptedsecrets.md 

# am lost, need help
charm crypt -h
```

## How it works

Encryption works by issuing symmetric keys (basically a generated password) and
encrypting it with the local SSH public key generated by `charm`. That
encrypted key is then sent up to our server. We can’t read it since we don’t
have your private key. When you want to decrypt something or view your stash,
that key is downloaded from our server and decrypted locally using the SSH
private key. When you link accounts, the symmetric key is encrypted for each
new public key. This happens on your machine and not our server, so we never
see any unencrypted data from you.
